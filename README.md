A plug-and-play bundle of Ren'Py-friendly minigames meant to spice up visual novels, prototypes, or jams without rebuilding common mechanics from scratch. Each minigame ships with standalone scripts, assets, and working demos so you can drop them directly into your project or study how they work under the hood.

## Included Minigames
- **Pong** – Two paddles, basic AI toggle, and adjustable speed curves.
- **Sigil Matching** – Pattern-matching puzzle featuring streak bonuses and score tracking.
- **Snake** – Classic growth gameplay with wrap/edge options for easy tweaking.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe** – Local multiplayer or simple AI opponent with clean UI hooks.

## Kit Highlights
- Drop-in ready Ren'Py `.rpy` files plus supporting assets.
- Shared helper utilities for menus, HUD elements, and notifications.
- Easily customizable constants for speed, score values, and difficulty knobs.
- Clear folder structure so new minigames can live alongside the existing set.

## Roadmap
More minigames are planned. If you have a prototype or mechanic you would like to see here, open an issue or pitch it in a discussion—this kit is meant to grow over time.

## Getting Started
1. Copy the `game/minigames/` subfolders you need into your project.
2. Review each minigame's scripts for settings marked with comments.
3. Launch Ren'Py, run the demo, and confirm everything behaves as expected before customizing.

## Contributing
Pull requests and issue reports are very welcome:
- Stick to Ren'Py-compatible assets and keep dependencies minimal.
- Document any new settings or files inside the minigame you add.
- Include screenshots or short clips if you are submitting a brand-new minigame.
